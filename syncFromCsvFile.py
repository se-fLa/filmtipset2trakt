# How to import Filmtipset to Trakt.tv:
# 1 Export your movies from www.filmtipset.se
# 2 Open the xls in Google Drive / Spreadsheet
# 3 Save as "tab separated file" .tsv
# 4 tr -d '\r' < FilmtipsetFixad.tsv > FilmtipsetFixad_unix.tsv
# 5a awk -F"\t" '{print "tt" $7 "," $6}' Filmtipset_20170109.tsv > Filmtipset_20170109_movies.csv
# 5b awk -F"\t" '{print "tt" $7 "," $5 "," $6}' Filmtipset_20170109.tsv > Filmtipset_20170109_ratings.csv
# NOTE: For rating to work it is recommended max synbc 200 movie ratings at a time, split your file like this:
# split -a 1 -d -l 200 Filmtipset_20170109_ratings.csv Filmtipset_20170109_ratings_part_
# and then sync them one by one and check numbers on your profile page in between.
#

# Fill in your application API client ID from https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications below
# or leave it empty and you will be propmted for it on execution.
clientID           = ""
# Fill in your access token (get it from getAuthorizationBearerAccessTokenCode.py)
# or leave it empty and you will be propmted for it on execution.
